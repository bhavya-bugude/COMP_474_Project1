PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Java Programming Assistant is an interactive chatbot designed to help users learn and understand Java programming concepts. It provides instant answers to questions about Java and offers direct links to official documentation for deeper learning.

FEATURES
* Natural Language Processing: Uses spaCy for intelligent understanding of user queries
* Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for a clean, user-friendly interface
* Documentation Links: Provides direct access to official Java documentation
* Comprehensive Coverage: Includes information about:
  - Java fundamentals (data types, operators)
  - Control structures (if, loops, switch)
  - Object-oriented concepts (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
  - Core Java features (arrays, exceptions, methods)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
* Frontend: Streamlit
* NLP Processing: spaCy
* Pattern Matching: Regular expressions and semantic matching
* Documentation: Oracle Java Documentation integration

HOW TO USE
1. Start a conversation by asking any Java-related question
2. The chatbot will provide a detailed response
3. For most topics, you'll get an option to view official documentation, type 'yes' to view it
4. Type 'bye' to end the conversation and it clears the chat history and starts a new one

RUNNING THE CHATBOT
There are two ways to run the chatbot:

1. Command Line Interface (chatbot.py)
Run the following command in your terminal:
   python chatbot.py
This will start the command-line version of the chatbot where you can interact through the terminal.

   streamlit run ChatbotUI.py
This will:
- Start the Streamlit server
